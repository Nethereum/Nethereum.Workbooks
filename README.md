You can find a list of all the workbooks on the [Nethereum documentation](http://nethereum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nethereum.Workbooks/docs/) or just browse through them in the [repository](docs)


## Workbooks contributionn
1. Any modificactions should be pushed on the Nethereum.Worbooks repository
2. Any new workbooks need to have a unit test associated with it, or changes unit tested before hand.
  For an introduction on unit testing workbooks [Check this blog post](https://medium.com/@juanfranblanco/unit-or-integration-tests-of-xamarin-workbooks-6f206b8483d6)
3. All the workbooks need to be in the same folder and indexed in the index.md file. See any entries on the index.md on how to format links.
4. The workbook applicationw will convert your workbook to a folder if referencing images locally, to overcome this use always "raw github" urls to the screenshots folder. This allows users also to download just the file directly to their drive.
