# Nethereum.Workbooks
Nethereum tutorials using Xamarin workbooks.

***Sadly Xamarin workbooks is not having any progress, now a better way to learn Nethereum is the Nethereum Playground at http://playground.nethereum.com.
This repository is archived now.***

"Xamarin Workbooks provide a blend of documentation and code that is perfect for experimentation, learning, and creating guides and teaching aids." For more information on installation requirements go to: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/workbooks/

# Workbooks
You can find a list of all the workbooks on the [Nethereum documentation](http://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/Nethereum.Workbooks/docs/) or just browse through them in the [repository](docs)

## Workbooks contribution
1. Any modifications should be pushed on the Nethereum.Workbooks repository
2. Any new workbooks need to have a unit test associated with it, or changes unit tested beforehand.
  For an introduction on unit testing workbooks [Check this blog post](https://medium.com/@juanfranblanco/unit-or-integration-tests-of-xamarin-workbooks-6f206b8483d6)
3. All the workbooks need to be in the same folder and indexed in the index.md file. See any entries on the index.md on how to format links.
4. The workbook application will convert your workbook to a folder if referencing images locally, to overcome this always use "raw github" urls to the screenshots folder. This allows users to download just the file directly to their drive.
